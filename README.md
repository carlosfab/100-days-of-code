## My #100DaysOfCode Log

- [x] **Day 6 and 7: March 05-06, 2019**
    
    * ***Today's Progress:*** I built a portable hacking station with a Raspberry Pi and Kali Linux.

    * ***Thoughts:*** With Wi-Fi on board and boot with SSH enabled, I can Command and Control my Raspberry from any device available. Highly discreet, small, cheap and powerful, this Raspberry runs Kali Linux natively. Very flexible, it is able to run a wide range of hacking tools with low footprint and power consumption!

    It worked exceptionally well as a platform for Wireless attacks (Wi-Fi jamming, reconnaissance and attack). The setup to create this hacking kit is minimal and required only a few components:
    
    * Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
    * Battery pack
    * Wireless network adapter (TL-WN722N)
    * 16GB Class 10 microSD
    * Wireless keyboard with touchpad


- [x] **Day 5: February 09, 2019**

    * ***Today's Progress:*** I created a script in Python that allows changing the MAC address of a given interface.

    * ***Thoughts:*** First time I used the subprocess built-in module. Also the first time I created some script for Pentesting in Python - there are great opportunities for learning in this field!

    * ***Link to work:*** [Mac Address Changer](https://github.com/carlosfab/mac_changer.git)
    
- [x] **Day 4: February 05, 2019**

    * ***Today's Progress:*** I Learnt hot to use json-server to an Angular application.

    * ***Thoughts:*** This was very interesting, because faking a server using a json-server allowed me to better structure the models for front-end Angular app.

- [x] **Day 3: February 04, 2019**

    * ***Today's Progress:*** I created a RESTful API for the Snippet App, started yesterday.

    * ***Thoughts:*** I used a free account at [mLab.com](https://mlab.com) to setup a new MongoDB database and created an API to communicate to the MongoDB.

    * ***Link to work:*** [Snippet App](https://github.com/carlosfab/snippet-app.git)

- [x] **Day 2: February 03, 2019**

    * ***Today's Progress:*** I started to build a full Angular app based on the MEAN stack, and finished prototyping/creating the mockups for the app project (Adobe Illustrator + Adobe XD).

    * ***Thoughts:*** This is a project based on [Gary Simon courses/tutorials](http://www.garysimon.com). He provides a lot of reasons about the importance of prototyping and creating mockups for website and app projects. What I learnt?! - **NEVER** go straight to HTML and CSS without first creating a mockup/prototype!

- [x] **Day 1: February 02, 2019**

    * ***Today's Progress:*** Understood Http data fetching with Observables, and Http put, delete with immutable state.

    * ***Thoughts:*** I completed 70% of the [Angular Fundamentals by Todd Motto](https://ultimatecourses.com/angular) and solidified a lot of concepts of Angular. This course is the best one I've ever found. Todd Motto is not only a great teacher but also promoted the best practices in this amazing Angular course.
