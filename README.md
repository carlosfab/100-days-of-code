## My #100DaysOfCode Log

- [x] **Day 4: February 05, 2019**

    * ***Today's Progress:*** I Learnt hot to use json-server to an Angular application.

    * ***Thoughts:*** This was very interesting, because faking a server using a json-server allowed me to better structure the models for front-end Angular app.

- [x] **Day 3: February 04, 2019**

    * ***Today's Progress:*** I created a RESTful API for the Snippet App, started yesterday.

    * ***Thoughts:*** I used a free account at [mLab.com](https://mlab.com) to setup a new MongoDB database and created an API to communicate to the MongoDB.

    * ***Link to work:*** [Snippet App](https://github.com/carlosfab/snippet-app.git)

- [x] **Day 2: February 03, 2019**

    * ***Today's Progress:*** I started to build a full Angular app based on the MEAN stack, and finished prototyping/creating the mockups for the app project (Adobe Illustrator + Adobe XD).

    * ***Thoughts:*** This is a project based on [Gary Simon courses/tutorials](http://www.garysimon.com). He provides a lot of reasons about the importance of prototyping and creating mockups for website and app projects. What I learnt?! - **NEVER** go straight to HTML and CSS without first creating a mockup/prototype!

- [x] **Day 1: February 02, 2019**

    * ***Today's Progress:*** Understood Http data fetching with Observables, and Http put, delete with immutable state.

    * ***Thoughts:*** I completed 70% of the [Angular Fundamentals by Todd Motto](https://ultimatecourses.com/angular) and solidified a lot of concepts of Angular. This course is the best one I've ever found. Todd Motto is not only a great teacher but also promoted the best practices in this amazing Angular course.
