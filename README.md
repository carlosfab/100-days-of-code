## 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: February 03, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started to build a full Angular app based on the MEAN stack, and finished prototyping/creating the mockups for the app project (Adobe Illustrator + Adobe XD).

**Thoughts:** This is a project based on [Gary Simon courses/tutorials](http://www.garysimon.com). He provides a lot of reasons about the importance of prototyping and creating mockups for website and app projects. What I learnt?! - **NEVER** go straight to HTML and CSS without first creating a mockup/prototype!

**Link to work:** [Snippet App](https://github.com/carlosfab/snippet-app.git)


### Day 1: February 02, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Understood Http data fetching with Observables, and Http put, delete with immutable state.

**Thoughts:** I completed 70% of the [Angular Fundamentals by Todd Motto](https://ultimatecourses.com/angular) and solidified a lot of concepts of Angular. This course is the best one I've ever found. Todd Motto is not only a great teacher but also promoted the best practices in this amazing Angular course.
