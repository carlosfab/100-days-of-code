# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 02, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Understood Http data fetching with Observables, and Http put, delete with immutable state.

**Thoughts:** I completed 70% of the [Angular Fundamentals by Todd Motto](https://ultimatecourses.com/angular) and solidified a lot of concepts of Angular. This course is the best one I've ever found. Todd Motto is not only a great teacher but also promoted the best practices in this amazing Angular course.
